# Snowpark-StreamSets
StreamSets Transformer for Snowflake is a hosted service in the StreamSets DataOps Platform. It leverages Snowpark Client Libraries to create SnowSQL queries. Pipelines built in the StreamSets canvas result in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which, combined with Snowpark, generates SnowSQL.
