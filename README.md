#  üìà A Dive Into Slowly Changing Dimensions with Snowpark and StreamSets

## 1. Overview
StreamSets Transformer for Snowflake is a hosted service embedded within the StreamSets DataOps Platform that uses the Snowpark Client Libraries to generate SnowSQL queries that are executed in Snowflake. Build your pipelines in the StreamSets canvas and when you execute that pipeline, StreamSets generates a DAG. StreamSets then uses the DAG and the Snowpark Client Libraries to generate SnowSQL. That SnowSQL is sent over to Snowflake to be executed in the Warehouse of your choice.

 ### How does it work

Transformer for Snowflake accelerates the development of data pipelines by providing features that go beyond a drag and drop interface to construct the equivalent of basic SQL. Snowpark enables StreamSets to construct the SnowSQL queries at the pipeline runtime, allowing pipeline definitions to be more flexible than SnowSQL queries written by hand. StreamSets also provides processors that combine the logic for common use cases into a single element on your canvas.

## 2. Prerequisites

# 2. Configure your Snowflake Credentials and Connection Defaults

   **Step-1** sign up (https://cloud.login.streamsets.com/login)

   **Step-2**  got to Account section  ‚è©  Snowflake Settings tab.

   <img width="941" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SRUSHTI2493/Snowpark-StreamSets/assets/87080882/00a65990-3d59-4b88-935c-3f15d5b99330">

  **Step-2**    Click On Snowflake Credentials -> Add, Give Your Snowflake account Credentials.

  **Step-3**  Fill Snowflake Pipeline Defaults which you have created though SQL Script

 # 3. Create a New Pipeline

 Once your credentials are saved, you are ready to build your first pipeline. Using the tabs on the left hand menu, select Build > Pipelines. Use the ‚ûï icon to create a new pipeline.

 <img width="950" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SRUSHTI2493/Snowpark-StreamSets/assets/87080882/6d4ebe30-d75e-48c9-b415-25741e31ae21">

 The New Pipeline window will appear, so enter a pipeline name and if desired, a description, and make sure that the Engine Type selected is Transformer for Snowflake.

**Add any users or groups for shared access to the pipeline, choose Save & Next, and then Open in Canvas.**

# 4. Code Snippets, Info Boxes, and Tables

Every Transformer for Snowflake pipeline must have an origin and a destination. For this pipeline, select the Snowflake Table Origin from either the drop down menu at the top of the canvas or from the full menu of processors on the right.

Click on the Table origin, under the General tab, and name it ‚ÄòEmployees', and on the Table tab, enter the table name EMPLOYEES. This will be the Dimension table that tracks the employee data.

Add a second Snowflake Table origin to the canvas. This origin will be for a feed of updated Employee data. Under the General tab, name the origin ‚ÄòUpdates' and on the Table tab, enter UPDATE_FEED.

At this point, run the first section of SQL in the SQL Script file to create and populate the EMPLOYEES and UPDATE_FEED tables in a Snowflake Worksheet. You will need to substitute the names of your database and schema into the script if you already have your own that you want to use.

**NEXT Select Snowflake Table**

# 5. Add Slowly Changing Dimension
Now add the Slowly Changing Dimension processor from the top menu (which only appears when the origin is selected on the canvas) or from the right side menu of all Processors. Make sure the Employees Table Origin is connected to the Slowly Changing Dimensions.

![image](https://github.com/SRUSHTI2493/Snowpark-StreamSets/assets/87080882/a13d78d1-c0cd-4fef-bb97-dcb88c89e75d)

First, connect the Employees origin to the Slowly Changing Dimension processor. Next, connect the Updates origin to the Slowly Changing Dimension process. The line connecting from Employees to the SCD processor should have a 1 where it connects to the SCD, and the line connecting the Updates origin should have a 2

In the settings for the Slowly Changing Dimension, add the following configurations:

üîπ SCD Type: Type 2

üîπ Key Fields: ID

üîπ Specify Version Field: Checked

üîπ Version Field: VERSION

üîπ Specify Active Flag: Checked

üîπ Active Flag Field: ACTIVE_FLAG

üîπ Active Field Type: True-False

üîπ Specify Timestamp Fields: Checked

üîπ Start Timestamp Field: START_TIMESTAMP

üîπ End Timestamp Field: END_TIMESTAMP

üîπ Timestamp Expression: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP (Default Value)

üîπ Behavior for New Fields: Remove from Change Data

# 6. Add Snowflake Table Destination
The final step to complete this pipeline is to add the Table Destination.

Select Snowflake Table from the "Select New Destination to connect" menu at the top of the canvas or the menu on the right, just be sure to select the Snowflake Table Destination, indicated by the red "D".

# 7. Preview Results
Now that the pipeline has sources and a target, there should be no validation warnings showing, and the pipeline can be previewed.

Activate the preview by selecting the eye icon in the top right of the canvas.
